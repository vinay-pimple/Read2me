<h1>Simple Speech</h1>
<h2>What is this app?</h2>
This is the simplest of speech apps. You type or paste some text into a textbox on the web page, and the app will read it to you.
<h2>Why this app?</h2>
I volunteered to teach a class to a coding camp for girls aged 8-15. They had worked with HTML. I had two goals:
<ol><li>Show them something interesting and unusual.</li>
<li>Show them how easily something seemingly complicated could be done.</li></ol>
<h2>Why does it work?</h2>
<ul><li>It's simple. The Javascript file has exactly 1 line of code. The body of the web page has two lines of code. The quality of the voices available today is great.</li>
<li>It's fun. The girls could type anything they wanted, and have it spoken back. This included wierd loops and vowel concatinations to produce strange tunes.</li>
<li>It's novel. Most kids that age don't know that the computer can read out loud. They connect with TextToSpeech differently from adults because learning how to read wasn't very far in their own past.</li>
<li>It's cutting edge, in its own way. Although TTS is almost 50 years old, Javascript got its speech API only a couple of years ago, in 2015</li></ul>
